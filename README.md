## Title: Real-time Guided assistance using computer vision for visually impaired persons.
## Overview
Visually impaired individuals often encounter significant challenges in navigating unmarked walkways and identifying potential hazards. We propose a computer vision solution designed to assist them in safely traversing walkways. This system will not only guide users along optimal paths but also detect and alert them to walkway imperfections, such as cracks or uneven surfaces, thereby enhancing their mobility and reducing the risk of injury.
